## Bare Bones Ray Tracing
A basic ray tracer that provides ray-object intersection support for planes, spheres, and rectangles.

### Sources
The following code was sourced from Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley:
- `vec3.h`
- `ray.h`
- `write_color()` in `color.h`
- The concept for `hit_record` in the `objs.h` file, as well as the function `set_normal()`
