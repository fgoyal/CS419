## Bare Bones Ray Tracing
A basic ray tracer that provides ray-object intersection support for planes, spheres, and rectangles.

### Sources
A majority of the code that came from other sources is from Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley. This includes:
- 'vec3.h'
- 'ray.h'
- 'write_color()' in 'color.h'
- The concept for 'hit_record' in the 'objs.h' file, as well as the function 'set_normal()'
